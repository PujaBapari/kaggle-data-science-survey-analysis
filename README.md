# 📊 Kaggle Data Science Industry Analysis (2017-2021)

An in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) investigating the trends, tools, and demographics of the Data Science community over a five-year period.

## 📌 Project Overview
The data science landscape is constantly evolving. This project analyzes annual survey responses from Kaggle to track how programming languages (Python, R, SQL), professional roles, and geographic participation have changed between 2017 and 2021.

## 📂 Dataset Source
The analysis is based on the official Kaggle Survey datasets. You can find the data used in this project here:
👉 [[[Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey Data]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/kaggle-data-science-survey-20172021)]

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Trend Analysis:** Compare the popularity of programming tools over time.
- **Demographics:** Analyze global participation and gender distribution.
- **Career Insights:** Identify the most common job titles and their growth trajectory.
- **Data Cleaning:** Normalize inconsistent survey structures from different years into a unified format.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Processing), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- **Tool:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Analysis Snapshots



- **Python Dominance:** The data reveals a significant upward trend in Python adoption as the industry standard.
- **Global Hubs:** Insights into why certain regions (e.g., India, USA) lead in survey participation.
- **Role Evolution:** Observation of how 'Data Scientist' has become the primary title compared to general 'Software Engineer' roles in the survey.
